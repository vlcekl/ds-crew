# Agent descriptions

## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning Agent
This agent is responsible for preparing raw data for analysis. It performs tasks such as handling missing values, detecting and correcting errors, normalizing data, and feature engineering. The goal is to ensure data quality and consistency, making it suitable for in-depth analysis and modeling by other agents in the system.

## Statistical Modeling and Analysis Agent
Focused on extracting insights from preprocessed data, this agent applies statistical models to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. It employs various machine learning algorithms to test hypotheses and predict outcomes, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying data dynamics.

## Causal Inference Agent
This agent specializes in identifying and quantifying causal relationships from observational data. Using advanced methodologies like propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and difference-in-differences analysis, it aims to uncover the cause-and-effect relationships that inform effective decision-making.

## Decision Analysis Agent
Integrating insights from statistical and causal analysis, this agent applies principles of decision theory to recommend actions that maximize expected outcomes. It evaluates possible decisions under uncertainty, considering both the probabilities of different events and their associated utilities.

## Semantic Analysis Agent
Tasked with enhancing the semantic understanding of tabular data, this agent interprets and assigns meanings to data columns based on context, relationships, and domain-specific knowledge. It plays a critical role in ensuring data from multiple sources can be integrated accurately into a coherent knowledge base, facilitating more informed analyses and decisions.

## Integration Agent (Coordinator)
Serving as the orchestration layer, this agent manages the workflow among all other agents, ensuring efficient task execution and data flow. It allocates resources, handles errors, and ensures the outputs from various agents are integrated seamlessly to achieve the system's overall objectives.
